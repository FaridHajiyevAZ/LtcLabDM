# LTC Lab DM Control Site

This repository contains the source for the **LTC Lab DM control** site. The site is deployed as a static website through GitHub Pages and served at [https://control.ltclab.digital](https://control.ltclab.digital).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm** – used for installing dependencies and building the site.
- **Git** – required for version control and deployment.
- **Custom domain configuration** – DNS records for `control.ltclab.digital` should point to GitHub Pages (`185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`).

## Building the site

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Generate the static files:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The build output should produce static assets in a directory such as `dist` or `build` (depending on the chosen tool).

## Deployment

The project is deployed via **GitHub Pages**. Pushing changes to the `main` branch will publish the latest build. GitHub Pages uses the `CNAME` file in this repository to configure the custom domain.

## Updating the custom domain

1. Edit the `CNAME` file in the repository root so that it contains only the desired domain name:
   ```text
   control.ltclab.digital
   ```
2. Commit and push the change:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "chore: update CNAME" && git push
   ```
3. Update your domain's DNS records to point to GitHub Pages, if necessary.
